title: 2021525 Combine 2 Off-The-Shelf Products into 1

Found a iShelf (sponsored by Raymond) from store room during spring cleaning the other day, and got a bag of VTECH/LEAPFROG educational toys for $5 at local OP shop, where 1 of them being a toy tablet with broken buttons. 
An idea come to mind, thought it would be fun to combine the clumsy iShelf into slim toy tablet as a digital photo frame.

Taking thing apart is easy. The challenging (and fun) part is to fit everything into limited space and make sure it works at the end.
