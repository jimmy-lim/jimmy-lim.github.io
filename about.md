### Personal Summary

I am a Systems Administrator / Software Engineer with 4 years New Zealand work experience and 4 years Singapore work experience *(as of April 2021)*. 
My technical expertise includes proficiency in various programming languages (C++, C#, Javascript, PHP), web/software development and automation scripting. Being fully in-charged for website and backend management systems, I am also able to find bugs in complex systems and provide front-line patches.
While I am able to write scripts to automate regular/manual tasks and turn client requirements into products that comply with defined standards, my greatest strength lie in problem solving, fast learning as well as produce detailed documentation.
